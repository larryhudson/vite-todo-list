# To do list with React + Vite

This is a simple to do list project. It's a demo project for me to play around with a [GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/about-creating-github-apps/about-creating-github-apps) that uses [Aider](https://aider.chat/) to automatically create and review pull requests.
